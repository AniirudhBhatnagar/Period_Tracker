      <p>
        MyRhythm is a wellness-focused period tracking website designed to help women
        understand their cycles, moods, and energy patterns with empathy and science.
        Our goal is to provide a safe, calming, and intuitive space where users can
        log symptoms, gain insights, and feel empowered throughout their monthly rhythm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Founded with care and research, MyRhythm believes that menstrual health should be
        treated with the same attention and design as any other aspect of wellbeing.
        We combine smart algorithms with a warm, feminine aesthetic to create tools that
        support—not overwhelm—you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're tracking for comfort, planning, or self-awareness, MyRhythm is here
        for every phase of your journey.
